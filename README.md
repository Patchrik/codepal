## General info
After learning React in a week at Nashville Software School we started on our 2 week project to make a capstone project that represented what we'd learned in 3 months. codepal is the result, a one page react application built from scratch in 2 weeks, using Javascript, React, JSON server, Material-Ui, and CKEditor for rich text editing.

## Technologies
* React - version 16.14
* React-Router-Dom - version 5.2
* Material-Ui Core - version 4.11
* CKeditor 5 React - version 2.1
* JSON-Server - version 0.16.3

## Setup
Things You Will Need - 
NPM installed on your machine - [NPM Install Instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
Once you have NPM installed you'll need to get JSON-server. [Get JSON server here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)
Alright we should be ready to go! Clone down the Main branch to your local machine.

Describe how to install / setup your local environement / add link to demo version.

## Features
* Users can create an unique account which is saved to JSON-server.
* A user that is logged in can create unique entries and unique tags based on their profile.
* A users tags, and entries can be deleted and edited.

	**To-Do List:**
* UI/UX needs work
* I would like to use a different Rich Text editor because CKeditor is a little difficult style.

## Status
Currently On Hold - Working on a different project.
